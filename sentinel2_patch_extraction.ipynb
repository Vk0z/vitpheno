    "# Explanation of the program\n",
    "There are three different loops that are nested. These will be explained below\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, the program reads the relevant variables that will be used. \n",
    "    - The folder where the Sentinel-2 zip archives are located, from which it creates a list of their paths named `sentinel_2_zip_list`. The zip files of the folder should be only Sentinel-2 zip files.\n",
    "    - The Corine Land Cover (CLC) info, which is the raster of CLC for Germany, and the pixel values list of the relevant vegetation group (DBL, EC, M). This list is named `clc_pixel_values`.\n",
    "    - The folder where the patches will be extracted, named `output_path`\n",
    "    - The envelope list, which is above for now.\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. First loop\n",
    "    - It starts to iterate the `sentinel_2_zip_list`. Each element of the list represents a different Sentinel-2 image.\n",
    "    - It creates a list of the rasters of all the bands in the 60m spatial resolution that are contained in the Sentinel-2 image, named `filtered_list`. Bands that are normally 10m or 20m are also included here, but resampled to 60m. This uses another small loop, but it is irrelevant for the explanation, so it is not counted.\n",
    "    <br></br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Second loop. Nested within the first loop\n",
    "    - It starts to iterate the `filtered_list`. Each element of the list represents a different Sentinel-2 band.\n",
    "    - It uses the `getContainedEnvelopeCoords()` function to create four lists of the coordinates of the envelopes fully contained within the raster. (i.e. that do not touch the borders of the raster). These lists are the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates, named `minx_list, miny_list, maxx_list, maxy_list`\n",
    "    - It uses the `imageNaming()` function to slice the name of the path of the band to use it as a part of the exported patches later. Example output: *20170420T103021_B02_10m*. It stores it in a variable called `raster_name`.\n",
    "    <br></br>    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Third loop. Nested within the second loop\n",
    "    - It starts to iterate over the different patches, using the `minx_list`. The coordinate lists have all the same shape, so any one of them can be selected for a loop.\n",
    "    - It creates an output name for the patch to be exported by concatenating `raster_name` and the ending '\\_Patch_' with an ascending number based on the loops iterator. Example outputs: *20170420T103021_B01_60m_Patch_1.png*, *20170420T103021_B01_60m_Patch_2.png*, etc.\n",
    "    - It uses the `exportImage()` function to crop the area from the coordinate lists `minx_list, miny_list, maxx_list, maxy_list` where the envelop is overlapping the band from the `filtered_list`. It exports it to the `output_path`, mentioned in step 1. \n",
    "    - Then it reads the patch that was exported, creates a mask based on the Corine Land Cover info provided in step 1 to keep only the pixels that have a value of the `clc_pixel_values` list and replaces the original patch with its masked version\n",
